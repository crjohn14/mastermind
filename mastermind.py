"""Solution for Praetorians's Mastermind Challenge
Chris Johnson
Date: 21 Feb 2018 - current

The challenge is a variation of the boardgame Mastermind in which 1 player creates a code and the other player guesses
until the code is found or they run out of turns.  After each guess they are told how many code elements were correct
and how many code positions were correct.  This version simulates fighting a number of gladiators, each of which are
weak to a specific weapon.  The player is given the number of gladiators and the number of possible weapons at the start
of each level.  The player is told how many gladiators were defeated and how many weapons were correct after each guess.

This solution utilizes a variation of Knuth's 5-guess algorithm .
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Algorithms)

The algorithm:
1. Build a set, S, of all possible permutations
2. Randomly select a guess from S
3. Submit the guess and get a response
4. If the guess was correct, then continue to the next level
5. Else, Remove all codes from S that would not give the same response
6. Repeat from step 2

Minimax was found to not be necessary (may implement later) when selecting guesses.

Level 4 required a different strategy due to the ~128 million permutations.  First the correct set of weapons were
determined by guessing from a set of all possible weapon combinations, which is only 177,100.  Once the correct set of
weapons is determined, further guesses are made from permutations of only those weapons.

I was unable to get past level 5 due to the server occasionally taking as long as 20 seconds to respond to a post
request.
